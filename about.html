<h2>personal statement</h2>
<p>
	I am a student in <b>HKUST</b>, and my major is computer engineering. Besides <b>programming</b>, <b>electronic engineering</b>, I also interest in
	<b>history</b>, <b>chemistry(especially something can explode)</b>, <b>Occult(knowledge of the hidden)</b> and anything <b>interesting</b>!
</p>

<h2>My projects</h2>

<div class="aboutme">
	<ul class="recent">
		{% for project in site.projects %}
	    	<li><a href="{{ project.url}}"><h3 class="project-name" itemprop="name">{{ project.name }}</h3></a></li>
	    {% endfor %}
	</ul>
</div>

<h2>Something interesting(or not)</h2>

<ol>
	<li><p>I've lived in three cities:<i>Chongqing</i>, <i>Beijing</i> and <i>HongKong</i>. None of them is my birth place. I've only little memory about my literal 
	hometown. In fact, we refer ChongQing as my actual hometown.</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm allergic to taro, but I really like its taste.</p></li>
	<li><p>Actually, my first choice of major used to be chemical engineering. There were other choices like nuclear engineering, material science,
	biotechnology, mathmatics and even had a period that I wanted to join up. Finally, I decided to study computer engineering only at the end of my first year in university.
	The reason why my choices are always about science or engineering is that most of my family members have a degree about science or engineering. 
	Maybe it's the tradition in my family to study S&T.</p><li>
	<li><p>Many of my user names and passwords come from my first girlfriend. Although we have broken up for a long time, I've set up most of my accounts.
	A sad story, each time I type in my password, I have to remember the unsuccessful love	╮(╯_╰)╭ </p></li>
