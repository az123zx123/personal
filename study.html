<h2>project experience</h2>
<h3>Visual Analysis of Big Data</h3>
<p>
  It's an undergraduate research opportunity program(UROP), which aims to provide some research experience for undergraduate students
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to develop a website that can provide information about passengers flow in the campus especially restaurants and bus stations.
  The observation of population is based on WiFi connection in this area. Intuitively, larger number of WiFi connection related to crowded area. The is observation is updated every 5 minutes./n
  Besides observation, I also developed a rough prediction of future population by some naive machine learning methods.
</p>
<h3>Indoor Autonomous Driving Robots</h3>
<p>
  It's a project concentrates on developing a slam system for indoor autonomous driving robots. After trying to merge several sensors in one autonomous system, we decided to use camera as major sensor. I developed a visual odometry system for the robots and some control parts.
